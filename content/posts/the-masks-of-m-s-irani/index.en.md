The shop half as narrow as its neighbors, and hidden beneath climbing vines of bougainvillea, had beckoned to him with the tinkle of small bells as he tripped, falling into the fragrant floral embrace of the shop's front facade.

If only he had known in that moment, that he was stepping over the threshold of the universe, past the illusion that sustains reality and into the beyond the beyond.
