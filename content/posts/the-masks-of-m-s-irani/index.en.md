The shop half as narrow as its neighbors, and almost completely blanketed beneath climbing vines of bouganvilla, had beckoned to him with the tinkle of small bells as he stumbled and fell into the fragrant floral embrace of its front facade.


He turned the door handle and stepped through the entryway of the Mask Shop of M. S. Irani. Even all these years later he still remebered the sensation of crossing the threshold. His gait was both speeding and slowing, almost as if his spirit body was walking steps in front of his corporeal form. It was both disconcerting and completely natural all at once. If only he had known he was stepping over the threshold of the universe, past the illusion that sustains reality and into the beyond the beyond.
