Was this the street? So many years since he, a frightened boy, so small and uncertain, had stumbled into this cobbletone corridor, on the surge of the colorful choas and cacophony of carnivale. The shop half as narrow as its neighbors, and mostly hidden behind climbing vines of bouganvilla had beckoned to him with the tinkle of small bells as he tripped and fell into the floral embrace.


He turned the half-hidden door handle and stepped through the doorway of the Mask Shop of M. Irani, over the threshold and into the universe, the illusion that sustains reality.
