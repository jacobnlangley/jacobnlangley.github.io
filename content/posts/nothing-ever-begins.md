This passage begins Weaveworld, by Clive Barker. I read this book many years ago as a young twenty-something. I have always loved this beginning. This embarkation. For some reason I have always remembered these words. I don’t know why I can recall this passage over so many other countless passages I have absorbed in the years since first I read Barker’s story. They have always been with me, words of fiction actualized in some small measure in the world through my own experiences. The words resonate. They have been my constant companions, silent and sleeping in the the small secret places of my being.

Somehow even as a young boy I understood on some deep unconscious level that these words had special meaning for me. Instructions, a blueprint of sorts. “Hey, listen up!” We are the words you need to know. Let us be your beacon. Bury us in the soft soil of your unconscious and we will become signposts along the path that will become your life.

These were words I had spoken at some moment, long forgotten and unrememebred, uttered in a life long lived and past and in this life pulled from the ether and penned by another.

There is no beginning. No point of departure. No destination. No place at which we arrive. Life is an endless series of moments that neither begin or end. Present and immediate.

This place for instance.
